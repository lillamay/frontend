### What I learned

I learn to use what I've learned about CSS and flexbox from scratch. I've been able to write the lines completely from memory and be as close to the design as I could. As I am a complete beginner, my code is probably not reliable and not that efficient.

I learned how to import a font from Google Fonts.
```html
<head>
  <style>
    @import url('https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Outfit:wght@200&display=swap');
  </style>
</head>
```
```css
.component {
    font-family: 'Outfit', sans-serif;
    }
```

I learned how to make rounded edges corner
```css
img, .component {
    border-radius: 25px;
}
```

### Continued development

I want to continue focusing on flexbox to understand how and when it is best used, and then learn more about responsive design and the differences between desktop and mobile design.

I want to be able to write an efficient code and understand my mistakes.

### Useful resources
